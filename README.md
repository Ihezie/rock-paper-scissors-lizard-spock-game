## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library


### What I learned
During this project, I gained a firmer grasp of the `useReducer` hook. I was able to successfully implement it along with other react hooks to complete this project.

### Continued development
In the future, I plan to learn how to code cleaner and less buggy animations. Perhaps I will need to learn a library such as framer motion. Generally though, I hope to write better structured and more reusable code.

### Useful resources

- [https://codepen.io/ofthedead/pen/rVLgNy](https://codepen.io/ofthedead/pen/rVLgNy) - This code sample helped me create the circular wave animation that is triggered when the result component is rendered.
